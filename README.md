#### This app is using options pattern as service to read JSON data from custom created file. In this example I read 4 social media links from the json file. The links are implemented depending on App's environment. So, in development env we are displaying only 3 links excluding "Instagram". Other than dev env we display 4 social media links including "instagram". I achieved this using <environment> tags in Index.cshtml.
